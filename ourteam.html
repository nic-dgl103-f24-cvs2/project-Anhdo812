        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p><strong>How We Began at Ascent Physiotherapy</strong></p>
        <p>
          Ascent Physiotherapy was founded with a simple goal: to provide expert
          care that treats each patient as an individual. Our team of
          experienced physiotherapists saw the need for a clinic that focused on
          personalized treatment and a holistic approach to recovery. Starting
          small, we aimed to create a space where patients felt heard,
          supported, and empowered. From the beginning, our focus has been on
          building lasting relationships, helping people recover, prevent future
          injuries, and achieve long-term wellness. The name "Ascent" reflects
          our belief that recovery is a journey, and with the right support,
          every challenge can be overcome. We're proud to have grown into a
          trusted clinic, and we remain committed to helping you reach new
          heights in your health and well-being.
